      "MoreInfo": "Danny Mahon is the antithesis of tradional folk music. No gentle, mellow tunes evoking images of English country charm, Danny is full, in yer face, punk played acoustically. A modern day Bob Dylan, Danny is a Mancunian urban poet of the highest order. His lyrics are explicit reflections of inner city life - not always comfortable on the ears. The music is a full rip roaring sound, not surprising given the musicians who helped out giving a 'full band sound'.\r\n\r\nHis double A side single Beat Me Up/AK47 is self released on Piccadilly Records and boasts an array of local musicians including Rick Lees (Twisted Wheel), Ben Taylor (Vagner Love), Johnny Winbolt - Lewis (Keith) and Tom Peek (Kid British). \r\n\r\nThis event is part of the Seaside Sessions promoted by Utopia Music Associates Ltd & Recession Sessions Promotions & Management Blackpool.",
