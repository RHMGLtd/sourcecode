      "MoreInfo": "FOX ELIPSUS, LIVE IN BLACKPOOL, ALL AGES, FREE CONCERT :D â™¥\r\n\r\n- Fox is coming all the way from New York for this\r\n- First ever Fox Elipsus concert in Blackpool!\r\n- Free to attend, no ticket required\r\n- Family friendly, all ages welcome :)\r\n- Fox's 26th of 69 UK shows!\r\n- Fox's only Blackpool performance on this tour :)\r\n- For the 7th time in a row I managed to start a sentence with \"F\"\r\n- How fantastic is that :)\r\n- Fail!\r\n\r\n- - Watch Music Videos: http://www.youtube.com/foxelipsus\r\n- - Hear More Music & Click \"Like\": http://www.facebook.com/foxelipsus\r\n- - Double CDs Cheap @ Official Website: http://www.elipsus.net/\r\n(Fox will sign and personalize your CDs if you bring them to the show!)\r\n(you can read more about Fox's mission on the elipsus.net website)\r\n\r\nFox is trying to help promote peace and saving the environment through his songs. He plays for free all over North America and Europe so that anyone can come and listen without having to pay. He even goes so far as to sleep in the rental car when on tour, to save money so he can keep going. The only way he can keep this going is by word of mouth. If you like what you hear or read, please click \"invite people to come\", select all your friends in the area, then \"send invitations\" so others can know about this. Alternatively, you could just watch Match Of The Day and forget you read this.\r\n\r\nIt means so much to Fox when lots of locals come to see the show. Some cities and areas are unbelievably welcoming and supporting, hopefully Blackpool will be one of those. We'll see, on the 22nd of August, it depends on how many people help out by sending out invites. Come if you can, and bring friends - remember it's free to come to the show, tipping, buying cds, and buying drinks from the cafe is all optional and Fox is only really interested in promoting peace and saving the environment - anything you buy from him online or at the show goes directly to petrol and food money - anything you buy from the cafe during the show is helping to support your local business :) Or you could stay home and watch The X-Factor because that lad from Luton that you like might still be in it.\r\n\r\n\r\nABOUT THE CONCERT & CONTACTING FOX\r\n\r\nThe messages of the music are serious and about issues that affect all of us, but the performance itself is also comical, and you'll probably laugh a lot. But as he often says, it's never quite clear if they're laughing at him, or with him - he doesn't seem to mind which it is :) Fox doesn't check facebook very often, so if you want to reach him fairly quickly, use his personal e-mail address - ELIPSUS@GMAIL.COM - he'd love to hear from you :) He'd also love to hear from John Lennon but that's sadly not on the cards, so perhaps you can write to him to make up for it :)\r\n\r\n\r\nOTHER UPCOMING SHOWS\r\n\r\nIf you're not in Blackpool, or travel a lot, you may want to look at this...\r\nFox is performing in every corner of the UK, Ireland, and Mainland Europe\r\nHere is a full list of concerts, every one of them is free, all ages and family friendly:\r\nhttp://www.facebook.com/note.php?note_id=135680143183024\r\n\r\n\r\nHere are the shows in the next few weeks:\r\n\r\nWeek of Mon 15th Aug\r\n\r\nMon 15th, 6pm -

Hotels are not financially possible so Fox sleeps in his car to continue the tour). The CDs in chronological order are \"Changing History\", \"Momentum\" and \"The Road\", sold online at http://www.elipsus.net/ with a credit card or PayPal. Isn't a PayPal a friend that is only your friend because you give them money?\r\n\r\nFor inquiries and comments, e-mail elipsus@gmail.com\r\n\r\nIf you want to make a donation, there is a button for that on http://www.elipsus.net/, or contact Fox at elipsus@gmail.com or simply PayPal them to elipsus@gmail.com - your donations have kept the music alive for 3 years now. THANK YOU! Read more about how you can help, here: http://bit.ly/BedBrigade - it's like the Fire Brigade, but Bedder.\r\n\r\nIf you want to lend a hand to help Fox spread messages of peace and love through music, email ELIPSUS@GMAIL.COM - This tour depends upon a lot of grass roots internet promotion, very simple tasks that Fox can tell you about one on one, tasks for all skill levels, 10 minutes a week and up helps more than you can imagine :) there's no heaven, it's easy if you try.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOX ELIPSUS, LIVE IN BLACKPOOL\r\nALL CONCERTS ARE FREE, FAMILIES WELCOME!\r\n\r\nFOX ELIPSUS coming all the way from New York\r\nThe only Blackpool performance of the tour...\r\nMonday 22nd August, 2011\r\n7pm until 9pm\r\nSan Marco's\r\n513 Lytham Road\r\nBlackpool, FY41TE, United Kingdom\r\n(01253) 404010\r\n\r\n(note: if you call ahead to this venue and they say they are not sure if or when Fox is coming... do not worry! :) Employees often don't inform all of the rest of the staff about free events. If you ask for the head manager, or whoever books shows, those individuals are more likely to be able to confirm this concert date and time. But remember - staff are very busy, and often forget. Fox will be there, at that address, on time, as advertised. Fox won't cancel shows or advertise the wrong venue or address. Fox will see you there, and is peeing his pants with excitement about this concert by the way) (ew) (I didn't mean it)\r\n\r\nThe 10 shows with the largest audience, the 10 shows with the most CD sales, and the 10 shows with the loudest people, will be immortalized on Fox's official website http://www.elipsus.net/ - so click \"invite people to come\", bring people if you can, spread the word, and enjoy the show... the word immortalized is a bit much so I will leave you with this instead:\r\n\r\nQ: what do you call a characteristic that is inherent with all people named Phillip?\r\nA: an in-Phil-trait",
