  "Bio": "Magic Trees is a fun, four-piece rock n roll troupe from Saskatchewan, Canada consisting of two couples who share a love of life, music and traveling. They cover classic rock with crowd pleasing favourites from Fleetwood Mac, the Beatles, CCR and the Kinks. The four met as actors performing Shakespeare in an outdoor festival before forming a ten-piece touring band during 2009. When that group started to dissolve with gigs still on it's calendar, Magic Trees sprang out and started gigging after only an eight-day rehearsal period. The next year was jam-packed with a prairie tour that took them all over Saskatchewan and Manitoba. The group is currently living in St. Annes, England writing and recording their second album. What a great opportunity to soak up some of the local music and meet some amazing people! \r\n\r\nLINEUP\r\n\r\nJason Moon - Guitar, Piano, Vocals\r\nIan Dickson - Drums, Guitar, Vocals \r\nColleen Moon - Keyboard, Vocals \r\nJaime Dickson - Guitar, Vocals ",
