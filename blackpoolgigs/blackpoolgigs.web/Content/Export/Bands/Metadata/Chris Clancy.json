  "Bio": "Hi, my name is Chris Clancy. I’ve been working in a duo called Silhouette for the past 4 years, but have finally found a little time for myself, to write and record some of my acoustic stuff. I’ve been pretty busy working in the duo, travelling and playing gigs all over, but now I’m at the stage to do some solo stuff I’m going to take full advantage and will be playing lots of different venues across the U.K.",
