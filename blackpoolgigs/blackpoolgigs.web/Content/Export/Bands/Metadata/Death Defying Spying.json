After accepting such a massive accolade, singer Paul was quoted as saying \" I'm made up, but its not about the awards, the glory, the beautiful girls, the yachts and rolling around in my own filth and money - its all about producing something together, and something for the fans - they're the real people, they're who we do it for. This is for them\"",
