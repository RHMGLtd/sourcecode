  "Bio": "The Dirty Daggers are a dirty rock band from Blackpool, England. Formed in 2008, they already have quite a few high profile performances under their collective belts, and with a set list packed full of filthy riffs and thundering basslines, The Daggers are now starting to establish themselves as one of the loudest and dirtiest bands around!\r\n\r\nBig thanks to the guys at Rock Hard Studios in Blackpool for our latest recording - it all went very smoothly and we are really happy with the outcome!",
