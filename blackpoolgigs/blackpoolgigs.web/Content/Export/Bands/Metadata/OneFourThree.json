  "Bio": "We all have a passion for music, and love sharing our passion :) We all come from different backgrounds, but found a common interest within music, so we have formed a band called \"One Four Three\" on the basis that you either love us or hate us! OneFourThree is a local teenage band of 3 pupils from Millfield Science and Performing Arts College and 1 at Blackpool and Fylde College. The band recently raised Â£250 for Phoenix Youth Theatre and have arranged a further similar event in August 2011 to benefit the Poppy Appeal and a local 8yr old girl with a facial tumour. The boys are hoping to raise their public profile by offering to play at local charity and community events. They are therefore offering their services to you for any future events or support for gigs and hope you will give them the chance to showcase their talents. If you feel you could use the band for such events, please do not hesitate to contact us.",
