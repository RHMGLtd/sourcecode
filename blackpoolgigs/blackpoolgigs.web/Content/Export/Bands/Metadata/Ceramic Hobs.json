  "Bio": "The Ceramic Hobs were formed in Blackpool in 1985 by Simon Morris and Stephen Lambert, inspired by the DIY cassette culture of the era. Since then the band with an ever-changing lineup have produced more than thirty uncategorisable releases on vinyl, CD and cassette for many different worldwide record labels and have regularly performed live shows in the UK and mainland Europe. They were extensively featured in John Robb's 'Death To Trad Rock' 2009 book and accompanying CD for Cherry Red. They have been closely associated with the civil rights group Mad Pride for over a decade and boast four band members with psychiatric diagnoses who have done time in nut wards. Their most recent release is an album called OZ OZ ALICE.",
