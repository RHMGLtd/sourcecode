  "Bio": "The Valvetronics are a Blackpool-based band, formed in summer 2007. Playing a range of both original and cover material, their influences range from Hendrix, Marriot and The Stones, to Oasis and The Brian Jonestown Massacre. The original line up consisted of Bass, Drums and three guitars, but the Valvetronics have played in various guises over the years, with a line-up of anywhere between two and seven members. The core of the band consists of Andy Docherty on rhythm guitar and vocals, Pete Harrison on lead guitar, Tony Fox and 'The Beast', and Dan Paige on bass. Playing a mixture of Blues, Rock and Funk with a particular 70s influence, The Valvetronics have a feel-good style that has been described as the Blackpool Boogie.",
