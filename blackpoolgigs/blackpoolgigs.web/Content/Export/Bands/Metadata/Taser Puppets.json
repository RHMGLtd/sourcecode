  "Bio": "Formed 2008, Taser Puppets are 3 people who play vocal driven music with vigour tightly laced with dark humour. A stripped to the bone sound where there's no place for guitar ego & the song is king. Having played most of the top venues in the north up to 2010, we've seen the pitfalls of pay to play, Anthony H Wilson wannabees, so we thought a fresh approach was needed both for us & the people who pay good money to enjoy music. Everyone deserves better.",
