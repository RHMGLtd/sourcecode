The Keswick Tweet Up 2013 (#northernTweetUp)
</h1>
<a href="index.html"><img src="keswick-tweet-up-banner.png"></img></a>
<p>
So, after the great success of the first keswick tweet up, we have organised another one, this time in Spring 2013. What could possibly be more enjoyable
than a weekend in the beautiful town of Keswick, all the little lambs gambolling in the fields and you staggering from bar to bar surrounded by
other awesome likeminded individuals.
</p>
<p>
As the plans become finalised, as per, I will add more details to this page (and tweet about it a LOT) so please do check back regularly. Presumably
we will be meeting in a pub, then going to another pub, then another, then maybe a few on to the (one and only) nightclub and then finally convening for an
end-of-weekend sausage fest at the Strawberry cafe.
</p>
<p>
In the 24 hours since the date was finalised I have already had 14 confirmed (some of them bringing partners) and 14 maybes so this looks to be a very
well attended event. There is no limit on numbers, however it would be really good if you could tweet <a href="https://twitter.com/rhmgroo">@rhmgroo</a> 
or <a href="https://twitter.com/lakeslandlord">@lakeslandlord</a> if you are interested, so we can make plans to meet at a venue which will accept such
multitudes.
</p>
<p>
For those requiring accommodation please click <a href="http://www.laterooms.com/en/k17384438_keswick-hotels.aspx#oyefxe">here</a> for a websearch I did earlier for you.
Just change the dates, sort by distance, and you're rocking.
</p>
<p>
If you want to have some more details, vote for your food preference, or just generally give someone a hard time please tweet <a href="https://twitter.com/rhmgroo">@rhmgroo</a> 
or <a href="https://twitter.com/lakeslandlord">@lakeslandlord</a> and one of them will probably help. Maybe. Depending on the time of the day.

ps: thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/foofig">foofig</a> for having the awesome idea of arranging a northern tweet up, seeing
as it's not right that all the southerners have all the fun!
