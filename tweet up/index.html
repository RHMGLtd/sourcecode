Welcome to our website for organising, and reminiscing about, our northern tweet ups. This is the place to come
to find out when and where the next one is, and to see pictures of previous events.
</p>
<p>
We have only had one of these events so far but by gosh it was a CRACKER. You can read all about the
<a href="keswick winter 2012.html">keswick tweet up winter 2012 by clicking here</a>.
</p>
<p>
We are now in the process of organising and arranging our next one. The plan is to once again gather in Keswick, as it
is an awesome place and <a href="https://twitter.com/TheStrawb">breakfast at The Strawberry is to DIE for</a>, and
are thinking maybe a Saturday in June or July for the date.
</p>
<p>
Please register your interest by tweeting <a href="https://twitter.com/rhmgroo">Bradato Kopele</a> or
<a href="https://twitter.com/lakeslandlord">Lakes Landlord</a>; we are very keen
for many new faces to show themselves and get involved in all the fun.

ps: thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/foofig">foofig</a> for having the awesome idea of arranging a northern tweet up, seeing
as it's not right that all the southerners have all the fun!
