The Keswick Tweet Up 2012 (#northernTweetUp)

<p>
There is going to be a Lakes tweet up taking place on 1st December in Keswick, Cumbria.
</p>
<p>
Everyone is welcome, though it would be good if you can @ one of us with confirmation
just so we can get a rough idea of numbers.
</p>
<p>
We have now finalised plans for the location and time for where we will be meeting up. We will be starting from around
4ish in the bar (obviously) of the <a href="https://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=george+hotel+keswick&hl=en&ll=54.60122,-3.135953&spn=0.008241,0.022724&fb=1&gl=uk&hq=george+hotel&hnear=0x487cc2477a050ef9:0xc5fde4338572418d,Keswick,+Cumbria&cid=0,0,8061278844922980873&t=m&z=16&iwloc=A" target="_blank">George
Hotel in the centre of Keswick</a> where we shall commence with drinks. We will at some point reconvene
for food and this is where we need your help. Our options are <span class="one"><img src="star.gif" />Indian</span>,
<span class="two"><img src="star.gif" />Chinese</span> or <span class="three"><img src="star.gif" />pub grub</span>. An unofficial straw poll
will take place on twitter to decide this, default position being <span class="three">pub grub</span>
as we will be there anyway.
</p>
<p>
After eating we will visit a few more of Keswick's fair establishments and stagger haphazardly
around the town until we cannot take it any more. Last one standing obviously wins something or other, though that could just be "the worst hang over award" the next day.
</p>
<p>
The morning of the 2nd will see us gathering at <a href="https://twitter.com/TheStrawb">@TheStrawb</a> in the centre of Keswick
for an excellent lakeland breakfast / hang over cure. If you would fancy just 
joining for this then again, please do make yourself welcome. This will be <em>heavily</em> discounted so you'd be
a fool to miss out.
</p>
<p>
We look forward to seeing you all at this seminal inaugural event, and raising a
jar or three together.
</p>
<p>
If you want to have some more details, vote for your food preference, or just generally give someone a hard time please tweet <a href="https://twitter.com/rhmgroo">@rhmgroo</a> 
or <a href="https://twitter.com/lakeslandlord">@lakeslandlord</a> and one of them will probably help. Maybe. Depending on the time of the day.

ps: thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/foofig">foofig</a> for having the awesome idea of arranging a northern tweet up, seeing
as it's not right that all the southerners have all the fun!
