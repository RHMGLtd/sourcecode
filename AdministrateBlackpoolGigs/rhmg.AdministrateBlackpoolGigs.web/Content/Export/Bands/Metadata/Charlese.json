  "Bio": "I've been singing since the age of 7/8. I was trained classically then discovered jazz, soul and motown! I've been working semi-professionally as a singer in bars, restaurants and in function bands for the last 7 years. In 2003 I went to the Liverpool Institute of Performing Arts to study a diploma in Popular Music & Sound Technology. After building a steady musical network, I then moved onto my other passion - Spanish!  Now that I have my degree I am putting my all into a career as a vocalist.\r\n\r\nAfter getting together with local musician, Tom Vernon, a well known jazz guitarist, we have started our own function band for parties, weddings and corporate events.  Although we are based in the North West of England we will travel anywhere! I also work as a solo vocalist with backing tracks or live accompaniment, a sample of which you can hear on the tracks here.  I am a flexible performer with an extensive repertoire of songs ranging from cool jazz and soul to popular motown, disco and current chart hits.  Whatever your requirements, whatever your function, I can fulfil all your entertainment needs, tailoring the style of music to suit the event and your budget.",
