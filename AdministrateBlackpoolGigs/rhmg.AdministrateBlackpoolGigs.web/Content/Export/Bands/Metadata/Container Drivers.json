  "Bio": "Bio:\r\nThe Container Drivers are a trio from NW England. At the moment we're best known for our Fall tribute, 'The Ex-Members of The Fall Club', which was released in the summer of 2004 on the German compilation LP 'Perverted by Mark E'. Our track picked up airplay on the John Peel show (\"this is very good\", was his verdict) and around Europe and the US. The much-missed Mr Peel also played a couple of our demo tracks in September 2004. Since then we had our shimmering cover of Television Personalities 'A Picture of Dorian Gray' released on volume one of the TVP tribute issued by Canadian label the Beautiful Music. We also contributed to the Cherryade Records Christmas album, volume 1. 'In the Bleak Mid-Afternoon' was favourably mentioned in reviews and likened to Belle & Sebastian. Hmm! Clearly we were showing our sensitive side on that recording.\r\n\r\nSince starting gigging in autumn 2004 we've supported bands including Persil, Decoration, Bearsuit and The Wedding Present.\r\n\r\nIn addition to being a Container Driver, Keg also runs the unofficial Television Personalities website called 'A Day in Heaven'.",
